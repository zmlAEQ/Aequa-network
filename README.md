# Aequa Network – Modular DVT Engine (Preview)

This repository hosts a modular, pluggable Distributed Validator (DVT) engine scaffold designed to run a validator across multiple cooperating nodes. It focuses on security, robustness, and observability, and serves as a baseline for further Layer2-oriented extensions.

What’s included
- Clean separation of core services (API, P2P, Consensus, Monitoring, State)
- Independent DKG tool entry (placeholder) and cluster-lock example
- Basic lifecycle manager and logging utilities
- Minimal E2E test scaffolding (placeholders)

Notes
- This is an early preview intended for internal prototyping. Interfaces and modules will evolve.
- Documentation and detailed plans are intentionally omitted in this public snapshot.
